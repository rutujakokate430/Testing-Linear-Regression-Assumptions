> This is one of the most commonly asked topics in Data Science interviews — and a crucial step in validating any regression model. In this project, we explore and test the fundamental assumptions behind linear regression to ensure our model is statistically sound and trustworthy.

## 🚀 What This Project Covers

Linear regression models are only reliable **if their core assumptions hold true**. This notebook demonstrates how to:

1. ✅ Check for **linearity**
2. ✅ Test for **independence of residuals**
3. ✅ Ensure **homoscedasticity**
4. ✅ Verify **normality of residuals**
5. ✅ Detect **multicollinearity** using VIF

## 🧠 Why This Matters

If you're building linear models in real-world or interview settings, **assumption testing is non-negotiable**. Ignoring assumptions can lead to:

- Misleading coefficients
- Incorrect p-values
- Poor generalization

This project gives you the practical skills to **validate your models like a real data scientist**.
